It determines the optimal settings of generator units with predicted load demand over a certain period of time. The objective is to operate an electric power system most economically while the system is operating within its security limits. This paper proposes a new hybrid methodology for solving DED. The proposed method is developed in such a way that a simple evolutionary programming (EP) is applied as a based level search, which can give a good direction to the optimal global region, and a local search sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is used as a fine tuning to determine the optimal solution at the final. Ten units test system with nonsmooth fuel cost function is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with those obtained from EP and SQP alone.', '2a047d8c4c2a4825e0f0305294e7da14f8de6fd3': "It's not surprisingly when entering this site to get the book.

The RFNN is inherently a recurrent multilayered connectionist network for realizing fuzzy inference using dynamic fuzzy rules. Temporal relations are embedded in the network by adding feedback connections in the second layer of the fuzzy neural network (FNN). The RFNN expands the basic ability of the FNN to cope with temporal problems. In addition, results for the FNNfuzzy inference engine, universal approximation, and convergence analysis are extended to the RFNN. For the control problem, we present the direct and indirect adaptive control approaches using the RFNN. Based on the Lyapunov stability approach, rigorous proofs are presented to guarantee the convergence of the RFNN by choosing appropriate learning rates. Finally, the RFNN is applied in several simulations (time series prediction, identification, and control of nonlinear systems). The results confirm the effectiveness of the RFNN.', '857a8c6c46b0a85ed6019f5830294872f2f1dcf5': 'Recent reports of a high response to bodies in the fusiform face area (FFA) challenge the idea that the FFA is exclusively selective for face stimuli. We examined this claim by conducting a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment at both standard (3.125 x 3.125 x 4.0 mm) and high resolution (1.4 x 1.4 x 2.0 mm). In both experiments, regions of interest (ROIs) were defined using data from blocked localizer runs. Within each ROI, we measured the mean peak response to a variety of stimulus types in independent data from a subsequent event-related experiment. Our localizer scans identified a fusiform body area (FBA), a body-selective region reported recently by Peelen and Downing (2005) that is anatomically distinct from the extrastriate body area. The FBA overlapped with and was adjacent to the FFA in all but two participants. Selectivity of the FFA to faces and FBA to bodies was stronger for the high-resolution scans, as expected from the reduction in partial volume effects. When new ROIs were constructed for the high-resolution experiment by omitting the voxels showing overlapping selectivity for both bodies and faces in the localizer scans, the resulting FFA* ROI showed no response above control objects for body stimuli, and the FBA* ROI showed no response above control objects for face stimuli. These results demonstrate strong selectivities in distinct but adjacent regions in the fusiform gyrus for only faces in one region (the FFA*) and only bodies in the other (the FBA*).', '12f107016fd3d062dff88a00d6b0f5f81f00522d': 'The energy usage of computer systems is becoming more important, especially for battery operated systems. Displays, disks, and cpus, in that order, use the most energy. Reducing the energy used by displays and disks has been studied elsewhere; this paper considers a new method for reducing the energy used by the cpu. We introduce a new metric for cpu energy performance, millions-of-instructions-per-joule (MIPJ). We examine a class of methods to reduce MIPJ that are characterized by dynamic control of system clock speed by the operating system scheduler. Reducing clock speed alone does not reduce MIPJ, since to do the same work the system must run longer. However, a number of methods are available for reducing energy with reduced clock-speed, such as reducing the voltage [Chandrakasan et al 1992][Horowitz 1993] or using reversible [Younis and Knight 1993] or adiabatic logic [Athas et al 1994].\n What are the right scheduling algorithms for taking advantage of reduced clock-speed, especially in the presence of applications demanding ever more instructions-per-second? We consider several methods for varying the clock speed dynamically under control of the operating system, and examine the performance of these methods against workstation traces. The primary result is that by adjusting the clock speed at a fine grain, substantial CPU energy can be saved with a limited impact on performance.', '1ae0ac5e13134df7a0d670fc08c2b404f1e3803c': 'Mobility prediction is one of the most essential issues that need to be explored for mobility management in mobile computing systems. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for predicting the next inter-cell movement of a mobile user in a Personal Communication Systems network. In the first phase of our threephase algorithm, user mobility patterns are mined from the history of mobile user trajectories. In the second phase, mobility rules are extracted from these patterns, and in the last phase, mobility predictions are accomplished by using these rules. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulation as compared to two other prediction methods. The performance results obtained in terms of Precision and Recall indicate that our method can make more accurate predictions than the other methods. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Given an undirected unweighted graph, structural graph clustering is to assign vertices to clusters, and to identify the sets of hub vertices and outlier vertices as well, such that vertices in the same cluster are densely connected to each other while vertices in different clusters are loosely connected. In this paper, we develop a new two-step paradigm for scalable structural graph clustering based on our three observations. Then, we present a <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\\mathsf {pSCAN}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href="chang-ieq2-2618795.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> approach, within the paradigm, aiming to reduce the number of structural similarity computations, and propose optimization techniques to speed up checking whether two vertices are structure-similar. <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\\mathsf {pSCAN}$ </tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="chang-ieq3-2618795.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> outputs exactly the same clusters as the existing approaches <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\\mathsf {SCAN}$ </tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="chang-ieq4-2618795.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\\mathsf {SCAN\\text{++}}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href="chang-ieq5-2618795.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and we prove that <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\\mathsf {pSCAN}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href="chang-ieq6-2618795.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> is worst-case optimal. Moreover, we propose efficient techniques for updating the clusters when the input graph dynamically changes, and we also extend our techniques to other similarity measures, e.g., Jaccard similarity. Performance studies on large real and synthetic graphs demonstrate the efficiency of our new approach and our dynamic cluster maintenance techniques. Noticeably, for the twitter graph with 1 billion edges, our approach takes 25 minutes while the state-of-the-art approach cannot finish even after 24 hours.'}
